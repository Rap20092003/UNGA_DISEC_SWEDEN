Honorable Chair
Distinguished Guests
Esteemed Delegates

Sweden is pleased to participate in this discussion.

Being a strong supporter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) we have ratified all of the major international arms control treaties, including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Convention on Chemical Weapons (CWC). 

The Middle East is one of the most volatile regions in the world. The proliferation of nuclear weapons in this region would pose a grave threat to global peace and security. It is therefore essential that we take steps to achieve this objective.

The best way to achieve this goal is through a comprehensive and multilateral approach. This approach should include the following elements:

listing
- **A commitment to nuclear non-proliferation**Â 
- **A commitment to nuclear disarmament**
- **The establishment of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone**

This is a critically important issue, and we are committed to working with all members of this body to achieve this goal. We believe that this is a necessary step towards a more peaceful and secure world. 

Let us heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me and the entire human race.

Thank You !










In addition to the above, Sweden would like to emphasize the following points:

- The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free warzone in the Middle East would require the cooperation of all countries in the region. It is important to build trust and confidence between these countries in order to create the conditions for a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
- The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free warzone in the Middle East would also require the support of the international community. The international community can provide support in a number of ways, such as by providing technical and financial assistance, and by guaranteeing the security of countries that renounce nuclear weapons.
- Sweden believes that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free warzone in the Middle East is a realistic and achievable goal. There are a number of successful models of nuclear-weapon-free zones around the world, such as the Nordic Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone and the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.

Sweden is committed to working with all members of this body to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free warzone in the Middle East. We believe that this is a necessary step towards a more peaceful and secure world.
