**COUNTRY**: The Kingdom of Sweden

**ABOUT THE COUNTRY**: Sweden, officially known as the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country located in Northern Europe. It shares borders with Norway to the west and Finland to the northeast and is connected to Denmark via a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund Strait. Sweden has a rich cultural heritage, with contributions to literature, music, and design. It is also recognized for its strong commitment to social welfare and progressive policies.

Sweden believes that a NWFZ would help to reduce tensions and promote peace and security in the region. Sweden has also called on all countries in the Middle East to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which began in 1968, and finally concluded in 1972, It is an international treaty that aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

**COUNTRY’S POLICY ON THE AGENDA:** Sweden is a strong advocate for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and has a long history of working to create a nuclear weapon-free world. In 1957, Sweden was the first country in the world to declare a unilateral ban on the testing of nuclear weapons. In 1961, Sweden became the first country in Europe to propose a nuclear-free zone in the Nordic region. The proposal was not successful at the time, but it laid the foundation for the establishment of the Nordic Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone in 1992. In 2008, the country submitted a draft treaty to the United Nations on the creation of a nuclear weapon-free zone in Northern Europe. The treaty has not yet been adopted, but Sweden continues to work with other countries to promote its establishment. Sweden is a member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017. Also a strong supporter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and have ratified all of the major international arms control treaties, including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Convention on Chemical Weapons (CWC).

**COUNTRY’S PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AND FUTURE PLANS**: Sweden will continue to promote nuclear disarmament in international forums, such as the United Nations and the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conferences. Sweden will also work with other countries to negotiate new treaties and agreements that reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons. The country will host a conference on nuclear disarmament in near future. The goal of the conference is to bring together countries from all over the world to discuss ways to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons. The country will work to promote the negotiation of a new treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. This treaty would build on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which entered into force in 2021. Sweden will continue to educate the public about the dangers of nuclear weapons and the importance of nuclear disarmament and also aims to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries to help to reduce the dependence on nuclear energy and to develop renewable energy sources.
