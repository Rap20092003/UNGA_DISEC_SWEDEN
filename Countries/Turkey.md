Sweden and Turkey have a long and complex relationship. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1737, and Sweden has been a strong supporter of Turkey's membership in the European Union.

In recent years, the relationship between Sweden and Turkey has been strained by a number of factors, including Sweden's criticism of Turkey's human rights record, particularly its treatment of Kurds and political dissidents. Sweden has also granted asylum to a number of Turkish citizens who are wanted by the Turkish government for political crimes.

In 2019, Turkey invaded northern Syria in order to combat Kurdish forces that it considers to be terrorists. Sweden condemned the invasion and imposed an arms embargo on Turkey.

In 2023, Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO, but Turkey objected to their membership, citing their support for Kurdish groups. In June 2023, Sweden, Finland, and Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum at the NATO summit in Madrid, and Turkey removed its blockade after getting some promises.

Despite the challenges, Sweden and Turkey maintain economic and cultural ties. In 2021, two-way trade between the two countries was valued at SEK 12 billion (approximately $1.2 billion). Sweden's major exports to Turkey include machinery, transportation equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Major imports from Turkey include oil and gas products, chemicals, and textiles.

Swedish companies have a significant presence in Turkey, with over 30 Swedish companies having an office or subsidiary in the country. Some of the most well-known Swedish companies operating in Turkey include Volvo, IKEA, and Ericsson.

Turkish companies are also investing in Sweden. In 2021, the stock of Turkish investment in Sweden was valued at SEK 239 million. Swedish investment in Turkey was valued at SEK 426 million.
