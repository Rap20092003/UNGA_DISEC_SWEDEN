Sweden and Iraq have a long and complex relationship. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1931. However, the relationship has been strained in recent years due to a number of factors, including the Iraq War, the rise of ISIS, and the current political instability in Iraq.

Sweden was a vocal opponent of the Iraq War in 2003 and did not participate in the US-led invasion. Sweden has also been critical of the Iraqi government's human rights record.

In 2014, Sweden joined the international coalition against ISIS. Swedish troops have been deployed to Iraq to train and assist Iraqi security forces in the fight against ISIS.

The current political instability in Iraq has made it difficult for Sweden to maintain a strong relationship with the country. Sweden has condemned the violence and instability in Iraq and has called for a peaceful resolution to the current crisis.

Despite the challenges, Sweden and Iraq continue to maintain diplomatic relations. The two countries have a number of shared interests, including trade, investment, and regional security.

It is important to note that the relationship between Sweden and Iraq is fluid and can change depending on a number of factors, including the domestic political situation in both countries and the broader regional and international context.

In recent months, the relationship between Sweden and Iraq has been further strained by the burning of the Quran by a Swedish-Danish far-right activist in Stockholm. The Iraqi government has condemned the act and has downgraded diplomatic relations with Sweden. It is unclear how long this tension will last, but it is a significant setback for relations between the two countries.
