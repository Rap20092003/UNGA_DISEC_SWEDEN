The relationship between Sweden and China has been strained in recent years, due to a number of factors, including:

- The Chinese government's human rights record, particularly in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
- The Chinese government's economic coercion of Sweden.
- The arrest and detention of Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai.

Despite the tensions, Sweden and China maintain economic ties. In 2021, two-way trade between the two countries was valued at SEK 171 billion (approximately $17 billion). Sweden's major exports to China include machinery, transportation equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Major imports from China include electronics, textiles, and machinery.

Swedish companies have a significant presence in China, with over 600 Swedish companies having an office or subsidiary in the country. Some of the most well-known Swedish companies operating in China include Volvo, IKEA, and Ericsson.

Chinese companies are also investing in Sweden. In 2021, the stock of Chinese investment in Sweden was valued at SEK 10 billion. Swedish investment in China was valued at SEK 20 billion.

It is important to note that the relationship between Sweden and China is complex and not static. The relationship can change over time, depending on a number of factors, including the policies of the Swedish and Chinese governments, the global economic situation, and public opinion in both countries.

In recent months, there have been some signs of improvement in the relationship between Sweden and China. For example, the two countries have signed a number of memorandums of understanding on cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, and climate change. However, it remains to be seen whether the relationship will continue to improve in the long term.
