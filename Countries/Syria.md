  

Sweden and Syria have a complex relationship. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1954, but they were downgraded in 2012 following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War. Sweden has been a vocal critic of the Syrian government's human rights record, and it has provided significant humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.

In recent years, the relationship between Sweden and Syria has been further complicated by the presence of Syrian refugees in Sweden. Over 100,000 Syrian refugees have sought asylum in Sweden since the start of the Syrian Civil War. Sweden has been welcoming to Syrian refugees, but their presence has also created challenges, such as integration and social cohesion.

Despite the challenges, Sweden remains committed to supporting the Syrian people. Sweden is a major donor of humanitarian assistance to Syria, and it is working to promote a peaceful and democratic solution to the Syrian conflict.
