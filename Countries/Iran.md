However, the relationship has been strained in recent years due to a number of factors, including Iran's nuclear program, its human rights record, and its support for terrorism.

In 2018, the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal. Sweden has remained a party to the JCPOA and has called on the United States and Iran to return to compliance with the agreement.

Sweden has also been critical of Iran's human rights record. In 2021, Sweden condemned the execution of Iranian wrestler Navid Afkari and called for the release of all political prisoners in Iran.

Iran has also been accused of supporting terrorism. In 2020, Sweden expelled an Iranian diplomat for his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate Iranian dissidents in Denmark.

Despite the challenges, Sweden and Iran continue to maintain diplomatic relations. The two countries have a number of shared interests, including trade, investment, and regional security.
