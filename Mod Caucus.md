**Current Nuclear Capabilities in the Middle East**

There is one known nuclear-weapon state in the Middle East: ==Israel. Israel has not publicly acknowledged its nuclear arsenal, but it is widely believed to have between 80 and 200 nuclear warheads.==

==Iran== is the only other country in the Middle East that is known to have a nuclear program. Iran has denied any intention to develop nuclear weapons, but its program has raised concerns among the international community. Iran is currently a party to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limits its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. However, the United States withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, and Iran has since begun to resume some of its nuclear activities.
