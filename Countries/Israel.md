Sweden has been a vocal critic of Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and its construction of the West Bank barrier. Sweden has also called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Despite the disagreements, Sweden and Israel maintain close ties in a number of areas, including trade, investment, and security. Sweden is one of Israel's largest trading partners in Europe, and there is a significant Swedish business presence in Israel. Sweden also cooperates with Israel on security issues, such as counter-terrorism and maritime security.

In recent years, the relationship between Sweden and Israel has improved somewhat. In 2017, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven visited Israel, the first visit by a Swedish prime minister since 2009. In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Sweden.

However, the relationship remains strained due to Sweden's continued criticism of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. In 2021, Sweden condemned Israel's airstrikes on Gaza and called for a ceasefire.

Overall, the relationship between Sweden and Israel is complex and multifaceted. The two countries have a number of shared interests, but they also have significant disagreements over Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
