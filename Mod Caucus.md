# 2. Identifying and mitigating current and potential challenges in establishing a NWFZ in the Middle East region



Lets be realistic about the challenges involved in this agenda and subject ourselves to ongoing and potential issues and do something about them.

Presently the ongoing instability and conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Libya makes it difficult to build trust and cooperation among the region's states.

There are some Nuclear Proliferation concerns like Israel being widely believed to possess nuclear weapons and not signing the Non Proliferation Treaty and Iran failing the Safeguards Agreement and being non-compliant to the same treaty.

There is also no clear consensus among regional states on the establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone. Some states, such as Egypt and Jordan, have long supported in its creation while others not so much. 

Coming towards the potential challenges we have issues like 

- **Security Guarantees:** Non-nuclear-weapon states in the region may be reluctant to give up their nuclear weapons aspirations without security guarantees from nuclear-weapon states.
- **Regional rivalries:**Â Such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Iran-Saudi Arabia rivalry creates disparity.

Despite the challenges, there are a number of steps that can be taken to mitigate them. Like 
- Building trust and cooperation
- Addressing nuclear proliferation concerns
- Building consensus
- Provision of security guarantee
- Management of regional rivalries.

The establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East will not be easy, but it is a goal worth striving for.

# 7. Deriving lessons out of existing Nuclear Free Zones and treaties that can encourage for actual mitigation of NWFZ in Middle East

Treaty of Tlatelolco (1967)
Treaty of Rarotonga (1985)
Treaty of Bangkok (1995)
Treaty of Pelindaba (1996)
Treaty of NWFZ in Central Asia (2006)

An important lesson that can be derived is that NWFZs can be created even in regions with complex political and security challenges. For example, the Treaty of Tlatelolco was created during the Cold War, when tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were high. However even being in such stressful situation the countries of Latin America were able to put aside their differences and agree to create a NWFZ. 

Even being under constant tension and regional rivalries if tried then a successful action plan can be prepared. If a few elements like security guarantees to non-nuclear weapon states, a strict monitoring and verification regime to ensure the compliance of laid rules
